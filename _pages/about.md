Hi, I'm Praneeth Balasubramanian, a Computer Science graduate student at UC Santa Barbara, with a B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering from BITS Pilani. I'm passionate about computer security research and systems, with a strong foundation in networks, operating systems, and architecture.

Previously, I worked as a Member of Technical Staff at DevRev, where I developed automated CRM solutions and optimized data storage techniques. 

In addition to research, I've built systems-focused projects like WebRTC GameStream, a low-latency P2P remote desktop app, and Algo-Rhythm, a web-based music player. Iâ€™m proficient in C, C++, Python, and Go, and have hands-on experience with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and Kafka.
